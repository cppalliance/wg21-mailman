# Local-dev settings overlay, imported at the end of the maxking/mailman-web
# image settings via `from settings_local import *`.
#
# Purpose: reproduce the production override mechanism locally, where
# wg21-mailman/settings.py registers a custom static dir + templates dir.
# In prod those are static_custom/ and templates/ next to the project; here
# docker-compose.yml bind-mounts them under /opt/wg21-custom/ (outside the
# web_data volume so the entrypoint's chown does not choke on read-only mounts).
import sys

# Dev-only: the maxking/mailman-web image hardcodes `DEBUG = False` in its
# settings.py and ignores DJANGO_DEBUG. Because this overlay is imported last
# (`from settings_local import *`), reassigning DEBUG here wins. DEBUG=True
# turns on debug tracebacks, static-view helpers, and django-debug-toolbar-style
# behavior. NEVER ship this to production.
#
# IMPORTANT: DEBUG=True is NOT sufficient for live template reload under uWSGI.
# In Django 4.1+ the default template config ALWAYS wraps loaders in
# `django.template.loaders.cached.Loader` (see django/template/engine.py) - the
# cached wrap only used to be conditional on `not debug` in older Django. That
# in-memory template cache has no mtime invalidation, so once uWSGI's worker
# loads a template it never re-reads the file. `runserver` circumvents this by
# subscribing to the autoreload signal that clears the cache; uWSGI does not.
# The template-loaders block below is what actually makes edits live-reload -
# see the explicit `loaders` key which takes Django's `else` branch and skips
# the cached wrap.
